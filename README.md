### 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the ML Hackathon – Set 1: Sentiment Analysis challenge.
The task was to build a sentiment classification model that detects emotions from audio clips of a TV show dataset. The model classifies each clip into one of three categories:

😊 Positive

😐 Neutral

😞 Negative

Although the original problem statement involved multimodal fusion (video + text), this solution focuses on audio-based sentiment detection.
